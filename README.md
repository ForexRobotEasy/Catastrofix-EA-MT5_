## Global Variables

- LotSize: The initial lot size for trading.
- StopLoss: The stop loss in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit in pips.
- RiskPercentage: The risk percentage per trade.

## Expert Initialization Function

The OnInit() function is called during the expert advisor initialization process. In this function, the risk management is set up by calculating the risk amount based on the account balance and the risk percentage per trade. The lot size is then calculated based on the risk amount, stop loss, and market tick value.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The OnDeinit() function is called during the expert advisor deinitialization process. This function can be used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Expert Start Function

The OnTick() function is called on every tick of the market. In this function, the expert advisor checks for a valid trading opportunity based on the correlation trading strategy implemented in the CheckCorrelation() function. If a viable trading opportunity is found, the entry and exit points are calculated, and a trade is opened using the calculated parameters. The function also prints a message indicating whether the trade was opened successfully or if there was an error.

## Check Correlation Function

The CheckCorrelation() function is responsible for implementing the correlation trading strategy. This function should be customized to suit the specific correlation strategy desired. It should return true if a viable trading opportunity is found and false otherwise.
